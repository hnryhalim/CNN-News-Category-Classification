# CNN News Category Classification
## Overview
CNN News is an international online news portal that provides news from all areas and many category of information.
The data used is news published from 2012-2022 by CNN News and I got this dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hadasu92/cnn-articles-after-basic-cleaning/data)
Published news has categories that are classified manually by the author, so there may be categories that are not relevant to the news description.
I want to create machine learning that automatically classifies news categories based on descriptions.
## Project Highlights
- **Data Understanding and Cleaning:** Thorough inspection, cleaning and transformation of datasets to ensure data quality.
-  **Checking Missing Values:** Ensure missing values ​​in the dataset.
-  **Text Processing:** Text processing is carried out to prepare text data so that it can be entered into a machine learning model.
-  **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understand data patterns and visualization
-  **Modeling:**
    - Logistic Regresion
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
## Skills Applied
- **Programming:** Implemented using Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Machine Learning:** Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualized insights using charts and graphs for better comprehension.
## Repository Structure
- `CNN_Articels.csv/`: Contains the raw datasets.
- `CNN News Category Classification Final Project (Revisi)/`: Result on portofolio.
